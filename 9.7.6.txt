Considering that the array is already sorted, a binary sort would be a great way to search for the location to add in a new element.
This is due to the fact that binary search works by finding a midpoint in the array, and checking if the element is greater than or less than this midpoint.
Then it continues by using a subarray on either side to check the element against the midpoint of that array until it reaches the desired location.
As linear search may need to loop the full array to find the data, the time complexity would be O(n).
binary search only has to search half of the array in the worst case, giving a time complexity of O(log n).
